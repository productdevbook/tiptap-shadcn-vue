## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- Bug fixes: `fix/issue-description`

- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements

## Coding Guidelines

### Vue Best Practices

- Use Vue 3 Composition API
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use props and events for component communication
- Document components with JSDoc comments

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid using `any` type
- Export types when they might be reused

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow ShadCN design patterns
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Keep styling consistent with existing components

## Component Development

### Structure

Components should follow a consistent structure:

```
components/tiptap/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TiptapEditor.vue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TiptapContent.vue
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TiptapToolbar.vue
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Component Communication

Components communicate through the editor instance provided by the `TiptapProvider`. When making changes:

- Maintain the existing props and events for compatibility
- Use the editor instance for commands and state management
- Emit appropriate events when modifying interactive elements

### Testing Changes

After modifying components:

1. Test across different content types
2. Verify behavior in different editor states
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Test accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
5. Verify performance with large documents

## Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release PR to the main branch
4. After approval, merge and tag the release
5. Update documentation if needed
